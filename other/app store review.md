Guideline 5.1.1 - Legal - Privacy - Data Collection and Storage


The app encourages or directs users to allow the app to access the camera and photo library. Specifically, the app directs the user to grant permission in the following way(s):


- The user is redirected to the Settings app to grant access before showing the permission request.


Permission requests give users control of their personal information. It is important to respect their decision about how their data is used.


Next Steps


To resolve this issue, please revise the permission request process in the app to not redirect users to the Settings app before showing the permission request.


If necessary, you may provide more information about why you are requesting permission before the request appears. If the user is trying to use a feature in the app that won't function without access to the camera and photo library, you may include a notification to inform the user and provide a link to the Settings app.

Guideline 2.1 - Performance - App Completeness


Issue Description


The submission includes content that is not complete and final.


Specifically, the app includes placeholder content.


Users expect the apps they download to be ready for public use and should not include incomplete or placeholder content. Apps shouldn't include placeholder or incomplete content or information.


Next Steps


Revise the app and metadata so that all of its content is complete and final.


Resources


Learn about app completeness requirements in guideline 2.1(a).



Guideline 5.1.1 - Legal - Privacy - Data Collection and Storage

Issue Description


One or more purpose strings in the app do not sufficiently explain the use of protected resources. Purpose strings must clearly and completely describe the app's use of data and, in most cases, provide an example of how the data will be used.



Next Steps


Update the camera purpose string to explain how the app will use the requested information and provide an example of how the data will be used. See the attached screenshot.


Resources


Purpose strings must clearly describe how an app uses the ability, data, or resource. The following are hypothetical examples of unclear purpose strings that would not pass review:


- "App would like to access your Contacts"

- "App needs microphone access"


See examples of helpful, informative purpose strings.
